me\\nPeaches and cream, sweeter than sweet\\nChocolate cheeks and chocolate wings\\nBut your wings are the devil's\\nThere is a bitter next to your sweet\\nKiss me, it's okay if it hurts\\nJust make it as tight\\nAs that I can't feel the pain anymore\\nBaby, it's okay if I  get drunk\\nI'll drink you in deep now\\nDeep into my throat\\nThe whiskey that is you\\n[Chorus: V, Jung Kook, j-hope]\\nMy

more, more, more\\nWant it more and more\\nMore and more\\nWant it more and more\\nMore and more, more, more\\n\\n[Verse 2: j-hope, SUGA]\\nIt doesn't matter if it hurts\\nTie me up so I can't escape\\nHold me tight and shake me up\\nSo that I can't come to my senses\\nKiss me on the lips\\nA secret just between the two of us\\nDeeply poisoned by the jail of you\\nI cannot worship anyone but you and I knew\\nThe grail was poisoned but I drank it anyway\\n\\n[Chorus: Jimin, V, j-hope]\\nMy blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance\\nTake it all away\\nMy blood, sweat, tears, and my cold

more, more\\n[Bridge: V, Jung Kook, Jin]\\nKill me softly\\nClose my eyes with your caress\\nI can't resist it anyway\\nI can't even escape anymore\\nYou are too sweet, too sweet\\nBecause you are too

you?\\nThe forest just for us, you weren’t there\\nThe route I took, I forgot\\nI even became quite unsure of who I was\\nTry babbling into the mirror, who the hell are you?\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]\\nFor you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad\\nFor you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt\\nI wish love was perfect as love itself\\nI wish all my weaknesses could be hidden\\nI grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true\\n\\n[Chorus: Jungkook, V]\\nLove you so bad, love you so bad\\nMold a pretty lie for you\\nLove it’s so mad, love it’s so mad\\nTrying to erase myself and make me your doll\\nLove you so bad, love you so bad\\nMold a pretty lie for you\\nLove it’s so mad, love it’s so mad\\nTrying to erase myself and make me your doll\\n[Hook: Jimin, Jin]\\nI'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love\\nI'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love\\n\\n[Verse 2: RM, Suga]\\nWhy you sad? I don’t know. I don’t know\\nSmile, say 'I love you'\\nLook at me, even I gave up on myself\\nEven you can’t understand me\\nYou say I’m unfamiliar, changed into the one you used to like\\nYou say I’m not myself which you knew well\\nNo? What do you mean no? I’m blind\\nLove? What the heck is love? It’s all fake love\\n\\n[Bridge: Jimin, Jin]\\nWoo, I dont know, I dont know, I dont know why\\nWoo, even I, even I don’t know myself\\nWoo, I just know, I just know, I just know why\\n'Cause it’s all fake love, fake love, fake love\\n\\n[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]\\nLove you so bad, love you so bad\\nMold a pretty lie for you\\nLove it’s so mad, love it’s so mad\\nTrying to erase myself and make me your doll\\nLove you so bad, love you so bad\\nMold a pretty lie for you\\nLove it’s so mad, love it’s so mad\\nTrying to erase myself and make me your doll\\n[Hook: Jimin, Jin]\\nI'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love\\nI'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love\\n\\n[Outro: Jimin/V, Jungkook/Jin]\\nFor you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad\\nFor you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt\\nI wish love was perfect as love itself\\nI wish all my weaknesses could be hidden\\nI grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true   \n",

singing\\nWhile you guys partied\\nI gave up sleep for my dreams\\nI stay up all night every day, holding my pen\\nAfter the sun rises, I close my eyes\\nThe double standard and all the opposition\\nAmid all that, I broke the limit of myself\\nMeanwhile, some are luckily picked up by an agency\\nAnd being forced to rap as they can’t sing\\nSuch a waste to call you a rapper\\n[Pre-Chorus: V]\\nEverywhere I go, everything I do\\nI’ll show you as much as I’ve honed\\nAll the people who looked down on me are now\\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Hey, shout it

major, hope you’ll be rotten like that forever\\nLike Rap Monster says, just like a monster I devour any kind of beat\\nDeserve to have my name? Guys, come on here\\nLook at the preview, the change of small fry idol\\nHaha, the pride of hip-hop guys said it’s impossible\\nBut take a look, there’s a period in it, I’m possible\\nNow you satisfied, boy?\\n[Pre-Chorus: Jin]\\nEverywhere I go, everything I do\\nI’ll show you as much as I’ve honed\\nAll the people who looked down on me are now\\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Hey, shout it out\\n\\n[Chorus: Jimin, j-hope]\\nOh, if you’ve done enough like me, throw a stone at me\\nWe go hard, we have no fear\\n(Click click, bang bang) We just sing it like\\n(Click click, bang bang) We just sing it like\\nOh, if you’ve done enough like me, throw a stone at me\\nWe go hard, we have no fear\\n(Click click, bang bang) We just sing it like\\n(Click click, bang bang) We just sing it like\\n\\n[Post-Chorus: RM]\\n(What) Now we’ll take it\\n(What) You’d better be nervous\\n(What) The ultimate king at the end\\n(What) We are bulletproof\\nWe are bulletproof\\nBulletproof\\nBulletproof   \n",

me\\nPeaches and cream, sweeter than sweet\\nChocolate cheeks and chocolate wings\\nBut your wings are the devil's\\nThere is a bitter next to your sweet\\nKiss me, it's okay if it hurts\\nJust make it as tight\\nAs that I can't feel the pain anymore\\nBaby, it's okay if I  get drunk\\nI'll drink you in deep now\\nDeep into my throat\\nThe whiskey that is you\\n[Chorus: V, Jung Kook, j-hope]\\nMy blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance\\nTake it all away\\nMy blood, sweat, tears, and my cold breath\\nTake it all away\\nWant it more and more\\nMore and more\\nWant it more and more\\nMore and more, more, more\\nWant it more and more\\nMore and more\\nWant it more and more\\nMore and more, more, more\\n\\n[Verse 2: j-hope, SUGA]\\nIt doesn't matter if it hurts\\nTie me up so I can't escape\\nHold me tight and shake me up\\nSo that I can't come to my senses\\nKiss me on the lips\\nA secret just between the two of us\\nDeeply poisoned by the jail of you\\nI cannot worship anyone but you and I knew\\nThe grail was poisoned but I drank it anyway\\n\\n[Chorus: Jimin, V, j-hope]\\nMy blood, sweat, tears, and my last dance\\nTake it all away\\nMy blood, sweat, tears, and my cold breath\\nTake it all away\\nWant it more and more\\nMore and more\\nWant it more and more\\nMore and more, more, more\\nWant it more and more\\nMore and more\\nWant it more and more\\nMore and more, more, more\\n[Bridge: V, Jung Kook, Jin]\\nKill me softly\\nClose my eyes with your caress\\nI can't resist it anyway\\nI can't even escape anymore\\nYou are too sweet, too sweet\\nBecause you are too sweet\\n\\n[Outro: Jimin]\\nMy blood, sweat, and tears\\nMy blood, sweat, and tears   \n",

fake love, fake love\\n[Verse 1: RM, RM & Jungkook, J-Hope]\\nI wanna be a good man, just for you\\nI gave the world, just for you\\nI changed everything, just for you\\nBut I don't know me, Who are you?\\nThe forest just for us, you weren’t there\\nThe route I took, I forgot\\nI even became quite unsure of who I was\\nTry babbling into the mirror, who the hell are you?\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]\\nFor you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad\\nFor you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt\\nI wish love was perfect as love itself\\nI wish all my weaknesses could

it’s so mad\\nTrying to erase myself and make me your doll\\nLove you so bad, love you so bad\\nMold a pretty lie for you\\nLove it’s so mad, love it’s so mad\\nTrying to erase myself and make me your

I don’t know. I don’t know\\nSmile, say 'I love you'\\nLook at me, even I gave up on myself\\nEven you can’t understand me\\nYou say I’m unfamiliar, changed into the one you used to like\\nYou say I’m not myself which you knew well\\nNo? What do you mean no? I’m blind\\nLove? What the heck is love? It’s all fake love\\n\\n[Bridge: Jimin, Jin]\\nWoo, I dont know, I dont know, I dont know why\\nWoo, even I, even I don’t know myself\\nWoo, I just know, I just know, I just know why\\n'Cause it’s all fake love, fake love, fake love\\n\\n[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]\\nLove you so bad, love you so bad\\nMold a pretty lie for you\\nLove it’s so mad, love it’s so mad\\nTrying to erase myself and make me your doll\\nLove you so bad, love you so bad\\nMold a pretty lie for you\\nLove it’s so mad, love it’s so mad\\nTrying to erase myself and make me your doll\\n[Hook: Jimin, Jin]\\nI'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love\\nI'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love\\n\\n[Outro: Jimin/V, Jungkook/Jin]\\nFor you, I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad\\nFor you, I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt\\nI wish love was perfect as love itself\\nI wish all my weaknesses could be hidden\\nI grew a flower that can’t be bloomed in a dream that can’t come true   \n",
